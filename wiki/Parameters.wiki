= &lang =

WebLoginPE separates all language specific strings into a separate file stored in /webloginpe/lang/ (the default is english "en.php"). You can help by translating en.php into another language if you are multi-lingual.

For instance, if you used the French translation, you would use...

{{{
[!WebLoginPE? &lang=`fr`!]
}}}

= &type =

WebLoginPE has many functions (and each of those functions has many functions). There are six basic types. They are *simple*, *register*, *profile*, *users*, *manager* and *taconite*.

  * *simple* WebLoginPE can handle most of the tasks involved in user management (Login, Logout, Registration, Profile editing, etc...). This is the default mode.
  * *register* handles all the functions of creating new users.
  * *profile* allows a user to manage the details of their account (their attributes).
  * *users* displays a list of all registered users (customizable and templateable) and provides links to view the user attributes individually as well as message the user.
  * *manager*, much like *users*, displays a list of the web users, but adds the ability to edit or delete any users. This should be accessible to Admins only
  * *taconite* provides the functionality of WebLoginPE but squelches the output so you can handle those functions asynchronously (AJAX).
