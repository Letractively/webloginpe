#summary The parameters used in an WebLoginPE call.

= &lang =

All of the language strings in WebLoginPE are stored in a file in /webloginpe/lang/ (default is *en.php*). You can help translate *en.php* if you are multi-lingual.

As an example, if you used the French translation, you would call it like this...

{{{
[!WebLoginPE? &lang=`fr`!]
}}}

= &type =

WebLoginPE currently has six basic functions that determines what it can do when you call it in a page in MODx. They are...

  * *simple* is the default mode for WebLoginPE.
  * *register* adds new Web Users to MODx.
  * *profile* allows a user to manage their account.
  * *users* displays a list of all registered users (customizable and template-able). The user can then view user's accounts individually, as well as message the user.
  * *manager* works like _users_, but allows for editing anyone's account (_profile_, but on a global scale). This should only be given to admins.
  * *taconite* provides the functionality of WebLoginPE but squelches the output so you can handle those functions asynchronously using AJAX.

{{{
[!WebLoginPE? &type=`users`!] 
}}}

= &regType =

There are two different types of registration...

  * *instant* allows the user to create their account and login with the username/password they chose.
  * *verify* makes the user to check the e-mail address they submitted for a password automatically generated by WebLoginPE. This makes sure the user "verifies" that they are a real user.

{{{
[!WebLoginPE? &type=`register` &regType=`verify`!] 
}}}

= &regRequired =

This parameter allows you to specify what inputs are required for registration. The attributes you choose *must* be filled out, else an error message will appear and notify the user of the field(s) that is/are not properly filled out.

If you use verify/confirm form field, such as their password, add...
{{{
.confirm
}}}
to the end of the field you want to verify/confirm.

{{{
<input type="password" name="password" />
<input type="password" name="password.confirm" />
}}}

{{{
[!WebLoginPE? &type=`register` &regRequired=`email,username,fullname,password,formcode,tos`!]
}}}
